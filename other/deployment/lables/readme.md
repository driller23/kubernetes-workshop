# To use this in a kind cluster:

Save the YAML content to a file (e.g., k8s-labels-selectors.yaml).
Ensure you have a kind cluster running.
Apply the configuration with:

```
kubectl apply -f k8s-labels-selectors.yaml
```

This will create all the resources in your kind cluster, demonstrating how labels and selectors work across different Kubernetes objects.
